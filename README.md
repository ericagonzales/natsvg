## Drawing on the Web SVG Assignment 4
### Spring 2016
----------------

I forked Natalia's SVG project for Assignment 2. Here are my changes:
- Changed the colors of the award logo
- Changed the colors of the music notes
- Added my name to the base of the award
- Added a stroke to the text

If you look at it through the html file, you'll notice these changes:
- Added keyframe animations (scale) over the notes 
- Added change in opacity for award and note hover states 
- Added difference in scale for award active state
